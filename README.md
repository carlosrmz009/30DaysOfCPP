# 30 Days Of C++

I'll make a C++ project everyday for 30 days.

_Pre-built binaries for 64 bit Windows can be found in the releases page._

_Day 1:_ **Simple Calculator**

Simple program which takes two numbers as an input, allows selecting between five basic math operations, and executes it. Uses the _cmath_ library for powers, _thread_ for sleep functions, and _chrono_ for time literates.

> concepts learned:
> - c++ file formats, installing compiler, and building.
> - basic usage of cin / cout objects.
> - float values
> - int / void function declaring and calling
> - importing of external libraries
> - sleep functions and time literates
> - if / else if operators
> - never trust vscode's error catcher, just build.

<sub> really, i spent almost one hour trying to fix an error that wasn't even there anymore...</sub>

_Day 2:_ **Rock, Paper, Scissors!**

You play against the computer. Every outcome is randomly generated according to the current time, to ensure absolute randomness. Uses _cstdlib_ and _ctime_ for boring stuff.

> concepts learned:
> - strings and constants
> - value comparisons
> - seeding and random generation
> - raw string literals for ascii art

_Day 2:_ **Bubblesort**

My attempt at a classic coding problem. Comes with some neat animations I made! Uses the _vector_ library for storing data, instead of a normal array, because of its dynamic size.

> concepts learned:
> - while loops
> - vector objects as arrays
> - pushback and swap values
> - difference between global and local variables

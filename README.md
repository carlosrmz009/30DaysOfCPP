# 30 Days Of C++

I'll make a C++ project everyday for 30 days.

_Pre-built binaries for 64 bit Windows can be found in the releases page._

_Day 1:_ **Simple Calculator**

Simple program which takes two numbers as an input, allows selecting between five basic math operations, and executes it. Uses the CMath library for powers, Thread for sleep functions, and Chronos for time literates.

> concepts learned:
> - c++ file formats, installing compiler, and building.
> - basic usage of cin / cout objects.
> - float values
> - int / void function declaring and calling
> - importing of external libraries
> - sleep functions and time literates
> - if / else if operators
> - never trust vscode's error catcher, just build.

<sub> really, i spent almost one hour trying to fix an error that wasn't even there anymore...</sub>

_Day 2:_ **???**
